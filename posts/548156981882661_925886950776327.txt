What do you like most about the Glee Club?
One of the best qualities of the Glee Club is the camaraderie. The memories made outside of working on music make the Glee Club  such a joy to be a part of.

What is your favorite memory from Glee Club?
My favorite memory from the Glee Club is going to Spain.  This includes watching construction workers get upset after our bus accidentally ran over some of their drying cement, waiting at a checkpoint while a police officer checked what we were carrying on our bus, and making incredible music with my Brothers in Song. 

What is your favorite food?
My favorite food is my mom's home-maid spaghetti with garlic toast!
