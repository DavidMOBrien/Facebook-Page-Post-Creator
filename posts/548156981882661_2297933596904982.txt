Our next Senior Spotlight is on Jacob Kline! Jacob is studying English Teaching and is from Cedar Falls, IA. After graduation, he hopes to find a teaching position. He sings Bass II for the Glee Club and has been with us for 10 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "I have made many great memories since joining the Glee Club, however, my favorite has to be the one that convinced me to stay with the group for as long as I have. In my freshman year at UNI, the Glee Club performed the halftime show for one of the football games along with the marching band. We performed "Pompeii" by Bastille and "Duel of the Fates" from Star Wars. The songs were okay, but the exciting part was the crowd of the game being so excited to see the Glee Club. After the show, I was approached by several people who wanted to know when our next performance was. I was convinced at that moment that the Glee Club was something very special, and I have stuck around ever since."

Thank you, Jacob! We wish you the best of luck going forward.
