Our next Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Aj Royer! AJ (left) is studying Psychology and is from Gilbert, Iowa. After graduation, he plans on taking an internship at Hyvee in Human Resources. He sings Bass for the Glee Club and has been with us for 9 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite memory was going to Ireland and Wales with the guys and singing in a pub with the Irish Men's choir."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, AJ!
