Our next Senior Spotlight is on Colin Hubbard! Colin is a Tenor 2 from Mason City, Iowa, and is pursuing a degree in Elementary/Middle Level Education here at UNI.

Colin's plans after graduation are to student teach in the fall, and then find a middle school teaching position.

One of Colin's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club is performing as an Arthur Murder dancer on the 2016 Christmas Variety Show.
