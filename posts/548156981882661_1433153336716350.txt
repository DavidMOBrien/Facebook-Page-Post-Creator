One of Kaleb's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club took place in Iceland last May. 
"After the Skálholt concert in Iceland, the Glee Club exited the church, walked down the stairs, circled up, and sang "Brothers Sing On" with a breathtaking view in the background. That feeling of brotherhood and the bond we all shared through that unique experience is something that I will never forget and always cherish." -Kaleb Olson
