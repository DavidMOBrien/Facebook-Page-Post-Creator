We are excited to make (another) big announcement today!

We have been establishing connections with our new sibling choir, the Heinz Chapel Choir from the University of Pittsburgh! The Heinz Chapel Choir has had a rich history under the leadership of 10 different directors over the course of 82 years as a choir! Although they are 757 miles away, the Heinz Chapel Choir shares many of the same traditions of the Glee Club. The Heinz Chapel Choir also has an annual Christmas Show, which is performed in the beautiful Heinz Chapel (pictured below), they also participate in international tours, as well as sharing a strong relationship with their alumni base!

Glee Clubbers Josh Dvorak and Owen Smith have been in frequent communication with them, and have planned some exciting things for the coming weeks!

We are so excited to start this new camaraderie with our sibling choir across the nation!
