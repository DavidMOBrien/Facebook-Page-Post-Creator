On Wednesday, we had the privilege to work with Dr. Rick Bjella, artistic director of the renowned San Antonio Chamber Choir. He worked with us on several of our pieces and spoke about the unique spirit of a men's ensemble.

It was a spectacular experience. Dr. Bjella left UNI with his very own Glee Club sweatshirt!
