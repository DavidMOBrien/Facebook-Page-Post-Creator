Our next Senior Spotlight is on Eric Pimentel! Eric is studying athletic training and is from Bettendorf, Iowa. Eric plans on continuing his education by going to grad school once he leaves UNI. He sings baritone with the group and is currently in his 8th semester in the Glee Club. 

Eric said that his favorite Glee Club memory was "After one of our concerts in Iceland that we didn’t have much of an audience for. That didn't bother us though as we still sang loud and with pride. At the end of the concert we all went outside and spontaneously circled up and sang Brothers Sing On. It was very emotional and a moment that I will never forget."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Eric!
