Thank you to all those who came out and supported us and enjoyed the Christmas Variety Shows! What a crazy and busy last week it has been for the Glee Club! Lots of work goes on for the shows to be successful, but all of the hard work is definitely worth it! Check out these photos of some of the action throughout the week!
