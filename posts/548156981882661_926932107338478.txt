The thing I like the most about Glee Club is just getting to go sing with a group of really cool dudes. Playing my trumpet with the PMB is wonderful, but nothing compares to being able to move people the way we do with our music.

My favorite memory from Glee Club comes from Iowa Tour 2013. We were in a barn somewhere in the Des Moines Metro area. We had lunch and played games, but my favorite part was the "HA!" tournament.

My favorite food is Canadian bacon-pineapple pizza. I can eat that stuff for days.
