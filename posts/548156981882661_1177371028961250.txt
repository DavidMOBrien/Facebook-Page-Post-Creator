Today, the group toured the city of Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. Stops on this tour included the Höfði House (where the Reagan/Gorbachev summit meeting took place), the town hall, the Perlan Building, and even Hallgrimskirkja, which is the largest church in Iceland. The guys were free to explore the city in the afternoon, and in the evening, they sang during Mass at Christ the King Cathedral. #TourXIX
