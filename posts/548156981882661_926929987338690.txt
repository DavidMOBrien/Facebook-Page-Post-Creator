What do you like most about the Glee Club? I love getting to spend time with good friends, sing amazing songs, make people happy through our music, and gain memories that will last a lifetime.
What is your favorite memory of the Glee Club? Going to Spain last May with the Glee Club was a life changing experience. Making music in buildings older than the U.S. and becoming closer with already good friends made the trip even better. 

What is your favorite food? Mac and Cheese for sure!
