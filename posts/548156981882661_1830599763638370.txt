Jake sings baritone in the group and is in his sixth semester with the Glee Club.

Jake said that his favorite Glee Club memory was "The run out to Minneapolis in the spring of my freshman year. The overnight stay in the city, as well as performing in a beautiful cathedral left a strong mark on me and made me truly excited to be part of the Glee Club."

You have been a great part of the Glee Club and we thank you for all you have done, Jake!
