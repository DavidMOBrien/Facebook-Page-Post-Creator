The Glee Club is currently on a bus heading for Cedar Falls! Our trip has finally come to a close.

Yesterday, we toured the stunning Chester Cathedral, located within the ancient walled city of Chester, England. We had some free time in the city, followed by a farewell dinner at the Church Restaurant. 

We are thankful for the memories made on this 20th international tour of Ireland and Wales. Thank you to all of you who have supported us throughout our travels.
