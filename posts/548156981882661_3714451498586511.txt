Our first Senior Spotlight of the semester goes to Cole Flack, our current Head of Music!

Cole has been studying Choral/General Music Education and has given his talents to the Glee Club for 6 semesters!

After graduation, Cole plans to teach in the Quad Cities area and has enjoyed going to the OP and playing "SpyFall" with fellow Glee Clubbers.

When asked why would he recommend joining the Glee Club to another student, Cole said: "You make friends of a life time. You experience every type of emotion within the Glee Club. You also experience genuine people. You also meet the best guys that you would not meet within your own major."

Brilliantly said, Cole! We wish you the best of luck going forward!
