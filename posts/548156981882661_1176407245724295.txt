Day 3 has arrived! Today, the group will visit the National Park of Thingvellir where the Great Atlantic Rift is clearly visible. We'll walk around the famous Geysir geothermal area, try some traditional Icelandic lamb soup, and then visit the Gullfoss (golden waterfall). We will end our day with a concert in Skálholt Church! #TourXIX
