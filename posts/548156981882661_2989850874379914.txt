Our next Senior Spotlight is on Joe Sterner! Joe is majoring in Religion and is from Oskaloosa, Iowa. After graduation, he will study for the LSAT in consideration of law school. He sings Tenor II and has been in the Glee Club for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite memory was when we sang "We Shall Walk Through the Valley in Peace" in the ruins of an old sanctuary at St. Kevin's monastery in Ireland."

Thank you, Joe. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
