The UNI Varsity Men's Glee Club holds "Three Pillars" that every member values and exhibits in everyday life. Any Glee Clubber would be able to tell you that they are "Excellence", "Tradition", and "Camaraderie".

We value the "Excellence" of our singers both inside and outside Jebe Hall. We push each other to succeed in our studies, classes, jobs, and song. Glee Clubbers have admitted to always being able to leave rehearsal on Monday and Wednesday nights in a better mood than they entered in, because of the relaxed yet motivating environment that the UNI Glee Club creates.

Throughout the years, we've maintained "Traditions" that our Brothers in Song before us have carried. The best example are the Seminars that the Glee Club holds after Wednesday night rehearsals at the OP. This is a time that fellow singers become brothers as stories are exchanged over pizza and song.

Finally, we share a sense of brotherhood and "Camaraderie" that comes naturally after singing on the great GBPAC stage during our Christmas Variety Shows or in Lang Hall at our Welcome Home Concerts.

If you would like to join the Glee Club and experience the Three Pillars for yourself, you can do so without ANY singing experience and without any audition of any form. Sign up on MyUNIverse with the course code MUS ENS 1100-05. You can also feel free to contact us on any of our social media platforms or reach out to our Head of Recruitment Josh Dvorak at dvorajac@uni.edu

Brothers Sing On!
