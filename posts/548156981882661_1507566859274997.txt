Last night, the Glee Club made their way to Urbandale, Iowa, where they performing a concert with the UNI Wind Symphony. It was a true honor to work with Dr. Ronald Johnson. Here are a few pictures from the trip up, as well as the rehearsal and dinner before the concert.

If you did not have the chance to attend the concert last night, you still have another chance to see it. Monday night, at 7:30 PM, we will perform the same great concert in the Great Hall of the Gallagher-Bluedorn Performing Arts Center. We hope to see you there!
