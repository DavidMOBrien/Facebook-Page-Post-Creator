The spring of 2020 is in full swing! For a few Glee Clubbers, this is their last semester with the ensemble. We appreciate all they have done for the group and feel they deserve to be recognized. Today begins our Senior Spotlight series!

Our first Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Logan Chaloupka! Logan is majoring in English Education and is from Solon, Iowa. After graduation, he plans on teaching English and Language Arts somewhere. He also anticipates owning a black cat. He has sung Bass in the Glee Club for 9 semesters and serves as our current chairman!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "Only a handful of people know the legend of "Quiet Brothers" from the Ireland and Wales Tour in 2018. It was a fair-weathered night in Llundudno, Wales, and about a dozen Glee Clubbers had gathered in a cramped hotel room overlooking the Irish Sea. Merriment was afoot. Playing cards flew across the table as well as wild, hilarious accusations when somebody in the room suggested we sing "Brothers Sing On!". We began with a lot of fervor and excitement when we realized just how late in the evening it was. Our solution? Start it from the top and sing it as quietly as possible so we didn't disturb the other hotel guests. This single rendition is something that I will carry in my heart forever."

Thank you, Logan, for all you have done for the group. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
