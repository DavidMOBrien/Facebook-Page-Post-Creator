Thank you to everyone who made it to the concert last night or watched the live stream! Your support throughout the year has been awesome and it has been our pleasure to perform for you. For some of our members last night was their last concert in the GBPAC and it was a great experience. Now we look forward to preparing for our tour of Ireland and Wales in May!
