Our next Senior Spotlight is on Clark Jackley! Clark is a Baritone from Beaman, Iowa, and is pursuing a degree in English here at UNI.

Clark's plans after graduation are to stay in the Cedar Valley area and work, while continuing to write. Hopefully, he will have a novel published in a few years and continue to pursue his writing career full time.

One of Clark's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club was during his time in Spain on the 2014 European Tour.
"One of my favorite camaraderie memories is riding a bus through Spain on the tour of 2014. While we were on our way to the next stop, I, along with Ben Owen, Jacob Ferguson, and many others, created nicknames for everyone on the bus. Mine was Farquad McStack!"
