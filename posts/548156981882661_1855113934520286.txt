The next Senior Spotlight is on Colin Mattox! Colin is from Bettendorf, Iowa and he is studying English with a double minor in theater and creative writing. After graduation he wants to continue on with his education and obtain a Master's of Fine Arts degree in playwriting. Colin sings tenor 2 in the group and is in his 6th semester with us. 

Colin's favorite Glee Club memory so far was "The very first Welcome Home concert, which was also my first concert with the Glee Club. Being a part of an inaugural show made me feel as though I was an important part of the group right from the start."

Thank you for all of your hard work in the group, Colin, and we wish you the best of luck with your future pursuits!
