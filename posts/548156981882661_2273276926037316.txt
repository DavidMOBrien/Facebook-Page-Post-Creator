This week we recognize Michael Fett in our next Senior Spotlight! Michael (left) is majoring in Liberal Studies and is from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He sings Tenor II for the Glee Club and has been with us for 10 semesters!

When asked what his plans are for the future he said, "There are no plans set in stone, but I intend on working and spending time with my fiance."

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "Hmm, there are so many good memories that I have from glee club. Maybe receiving my shield? Or the overnight trip to Minneapolis? No, it's probably when I ran to Jordan Barrow's dorm room sophomore year and woke him up 10 minutes before the start of our matinee performance. PS. He made it too."

Thank you for all of your commitment to this ensemble, Michael. We wish you the best of luck in the future!
