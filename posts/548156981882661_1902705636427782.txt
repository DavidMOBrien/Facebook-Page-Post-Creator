Our last full day in Ireland has been a blast! We started our morning with a trip through the Wicklow Mountains, stopping at a small church for a recording session before lunch.

Later, we visited Glendalough, a large glacial valley with lakes, waterfalls, and lush grass fields. In this valley, we toured the ruins of a 6th century Christian monastic city, founded by St. Kevin. The glee clubbers were given the rare opportunity to sing in the St. Kevin Church! Unforgettable!

It was a beautiful day with lots of sunshine, laughter, and song.
