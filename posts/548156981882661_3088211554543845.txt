Push forward to the 1970s, the Glee Club recorded this beautiful piece titled, "Vive L'Amour".

Listen closely for these uplifting lyrics:

"With friends all around us, we'll sing out our song
Vive la Compagnie!
We'll banish our troubles, it won't take us long
Vive la Compagnie!

Should time or occasion, compel us to part
Vive la Compagnie!
These days shall forever, enliven our heart
Vive la Compagnie!"
