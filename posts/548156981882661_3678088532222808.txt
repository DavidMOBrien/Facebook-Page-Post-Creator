Alex Johnson and Madeleine Hartleip have been doing a spectacular job working with the Northeast Iowa Food Bank in the past few weeks for their Experiential Learning Project in the Glee Club!

Alex has a message for all of you:

"As a Glee Club, we are dedicated to changing the world, through the power of our music. This year, thousands of families in Northeast Iowa are struggling with food insecurity. In Black Hawk County alone, over 18,000 people are food insecure and almost 5,000 are children. So, the Glee Club will be raising funds this semester for the Northeast Iowa Food Bank! Each dollar we raise will provide up to four meals for Iowans who need it. We are excited to share our plans for raising money for the Northeast Iowa Food Bank very soon!"
