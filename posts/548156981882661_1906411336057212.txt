The Glee Club has been busy these past few days! Here is a quick update of what we experienced both Friday and Saturday:

On Friday, the group visited a village called Betws-y-Coed in Wales. The group had free time to roam, grab lunch, play games, and enjoy the incredible views this area had to offer. Later, we stopped by Swallow Falls. This massive series of cascades and rapids were incredible to see! Following the falls, we hopped a train up Mount Snowdon to the highest peak in Wales! One can see for miles on end at the top of this mountain. Lastly, we arrived at St. Michael's Church in Abergele to perform a joint concert with an incredible girls children's choir.

On Saturday, we boarded the coach for England to visit Liverpool. The group took an audio tour of the Liverpool Football Club's stadium, Anfield, then another tour of The Beatles Story, a museum devoted to the life of the famous four. We had some nice free time to explore Liverpool following our last tour. Lastly, back in Wales, we arrived at St. John's Methodist Church for a joint concert with the amazing Colwyn Bay Male Voice Choir. It was a stunning performance from both ensembles!
