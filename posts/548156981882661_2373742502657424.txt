Our last Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Evan Jones! Evan is studying Management and Information Systems and is from Sioux City, IA. After graduation, he plans on finding employment near Cedar Falls in his field of study. He sings Tenor 2 for the Glee Club and has been with us for 10 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "While taking a tour in a castle in Wales, Adam Sitzmann and I decided to stray from the pack. While we missed out on some really interesting historical facts about the place, we were able to explore a castle, climb the towers, and look out over the ocean from atop such an ancient structure."

Thank you for sharing, Evan. We appreciate all you have done for this ensemble and wish you the best of luck going forward!
