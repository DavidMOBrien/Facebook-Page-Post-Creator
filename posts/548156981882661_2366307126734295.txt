We invite you to attend our small group's performance on Monday, April 15th at noon in the Schindler Education Center!

SingPins a cappella, a select ensemble within the UNI Varsity Men's Glee Club, has been working hard on many contemporary songs. Feel free to stop by for lunch or in between classes. They hope to see you there for an amazing show!
