What do you like most about the Glee Club? I like how, no matter what else is going on in life, there are two hours set aside twice a week to make music. It's a pretty remarkable thing.
Favorite Glee Club Memory: Playing games in the barn during Iowa Tour 2013. You don't know what intense is until you've played "Ha!"
Favorite food: I'm on a pretty big Cinnamon Toast Crunch kick currently.
