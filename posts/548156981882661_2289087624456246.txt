The Glee Club has been going to the Other Place on the Hill for many years now, and the tradition continues just as strong as ever! Last night we had many of our members go to the OP after rehearsal for a time of singing and camaraderie! The semester is off to a strong start, and we are excited to begin sharing music with everyone!
