On Saturday we had the honor of traveling to Albia, Iowa to perform in the King Opera House! The town of Albia was very welcoming and the Opera House was completely sold out for the performance! Thank you to the people of Albia for hosting us and allowing us to have such a fun and wonderful concert!
