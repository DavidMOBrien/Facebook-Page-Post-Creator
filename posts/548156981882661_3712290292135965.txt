As some of you may have heard, our Christmas Variety Shows will not occur this year.

However, the Glee Club will still continue to create music for your families and still strives every day to make the world a better place.

This semester, we have compiled a plentiful amount of past Christmas Variety Show songs and have created recordings for our traditional pieces throughout this semester ( each singer recorded individually! )

We are also glad to announce that all proceeds for this CD will be donated to the Northeast Iowa Food Bank as well, please continue to visit their website here: https://www.northeastiowafoodbank.org/

And get this, you can preorder our CD TODAY! For just $12 you can ensure that the songs of the Christmas Variety Shows can be brought to your homes this winter! The link to the preorder is attached below!
