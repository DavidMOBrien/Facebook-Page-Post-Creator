To our fans, alumni, friends, and family,

Due to regulations regarding COVID-19, the remainder of our semester has been discontinued. Our international trip to Vietnam has been postponed to May of 2021. This is sad news for all Glee Clubbers. We are temporarily prohibited from doing what many of us love most - making music to lift up, inspire, and make the world a better place. We look forward to seeing you again soon.

To remain in good spirits throughout the upcoming months, we will be working hard to provide you with happy thoughts and beautiful music via social media. Stay tuned! We are wishing everyone good health and happiness during this difficult time.

Regards,

The UNI Varsity Men's Glee Club
