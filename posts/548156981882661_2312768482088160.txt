This week we recognize Jordan Evans in our next Senior Spotlight! Jordan is majoring in Environmental Science and is from Cedar Falls, Iowa. After graduation, he plans to move northwest to work in a National Park. He sings Bass for the Glee Club and has been with us for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite Glee Club memory is the trip that we took to Ireland and Wales in the Summer of 2018. It was my first time leaving the country and it was an unbelievable experience."

Thank you for all of your commitment to this ensemble, Jordan. We wish you the best of luck in the future!
