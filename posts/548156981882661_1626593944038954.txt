As we wrap up the summer and welcome students back to campus we want to invite everyone to our first concert! Next Friday, the 25th of August, we will be having a concert in Lang Hall Auditorium at 6 PM! This is a great concert to pump up the Panther spirit with music and games! The concert is free, but a suggested donation of $3 dollars will be taken with all proceeds going to the Northeast Iowa Food Bank! We hope to see you all there!
