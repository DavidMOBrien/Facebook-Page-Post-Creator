Check out this Senior Spotlight on Micah Otterbein! Micah is studying Mathematics-Teaching and is from Coralville, IA. After graduation, he plans on being a math tutor. He sings Bass II for the Glee Club and has been with us for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "While I loved my time singing in Christmas shows and on tour with the Glee Club, my favorite Glee Club memory is being a part of the Christmas plays all 4 years. My favorite role was "Bandage", the elf on the shelf, because of the great and silent interactions I got to have with the guys and audience."

We appreciate everything you do for this group, Micah. Thank you and best of luck in the future!
