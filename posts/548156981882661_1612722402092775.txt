Friends, we are sad to announce that Dr. Les Hale, our Founder and Director of 14 years passed away last night. Dr. Hale embodied the Glee Club motto by leading thousands to learn that music can lift up, inspire, and help make the world a better place. His career is truly remarkable and his life is legendary to us. We will keep you updated on plans for a memorial service as they become finalized. Brothers (and Sisters!), Sing On.
