The next Spotlight is on Nathan Hummel! Nathan is a meteorology major and is from Waverly, IA. He plans on transferring to another university to further his studies in meteorology. Nathan is in his 4th semester with the Glee Club and sings bass.

Nathan said his favorite Glee Club memory is "Seeing the expression of the audience as they enjoy every performance of ours. The Christmas Variety Show was always my favorite thing to do. It’s amazing to say I have performed in front of 1,500 people before. I look forward to the Ireland and Wales Tour before I head off to another college."

Thank you Nathan for your commitment to the Glee Club and we wish you the best of luck!
