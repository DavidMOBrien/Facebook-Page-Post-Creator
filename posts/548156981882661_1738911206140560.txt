Our final Senior Spotlight for this semester is on Azeem Ward! Azeem is a graduate student from Hayward, California, and is  currently at UNI getting his Master's of Flute Performance. After graduation he plans on moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music, hoping to teach private lessons, produce, compose, and perform. 

Azeem is currently in his 1st semester with the Glee Club and he sings baritone with the group. His favorite Glee Club memories are how our director, Dr. Wiles, has made practices fun and entertaining through his funny stories and joking! 

Thank you for all of your work for the Glee Club, Azeem!
