Did you enjoy the Christmas Variety Show? Can't wait to see it next year? Help us make next year's show better by helping us with our fundraiser campaign. 

The Glee Club uses donations to improve the Christmas Variety Show, and to travel all over the state and globe to share the power of music. Please help us in that cause. Any amount helps.
