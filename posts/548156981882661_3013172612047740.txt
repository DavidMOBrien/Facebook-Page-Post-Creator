Our next Senior Spotlight is on Michael Krueger! Michael is majoring in Criminology with an emphasis in Criminal Justice. He is from Muscatine, Iowa. After graduation, he plans on being hired as a police officer in the Cedar Falls area. He sings Bass and has been in the Glee Club for 10 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "I've enjoyed all the Wednesdays spent at the OP - sharing beer, pizza, and stories."

Thank you, Michael. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
