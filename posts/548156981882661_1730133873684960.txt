Our next Senior Spotlight is on Will Van Roekel! Will is from Urbandale, IA and is majoring in Gerontology Long Term Care Administration! Will is currently in his 7th semester with the Glee Club and he sings baritone with the group! 

His favorite Glee Club memory "Was when the Glee Club went to Iceland and Norway. When we were in Norway we stayed at a hotel up in the mountains and fellow Glee Clubber Jacob J. Ferguson  rented out an acoustic guitar. He played some songs  and all the guys in the Glee Club sang with him from the top of a mountain overlooking Bergen. That kind of thing doesn't happen very often. Hopefully we can top that in Ireland and Wales this spring."

Thanks for all you have done for the group, Will!
