Last night, the Glee Club sang in concert with an Irish men's chorus! The venue we performed in was a large Presbyterian church in the city of Dublin. Following the concert, many Glee Clubbers joined a post-concert reception with the chorus, bonding and singing lively songs of commonality together.

This morning, we said farewell to Ireland, boarding a ferry headed across the Irish Sea for Wales. Upon arrival, we visited the city of Llandudno, home of the massive Caernarfon Castle. We toured the castle, sang, then departed for check-in at our seaside hotel!

The rest of our day was spent roaming the streets and walking the beach adjacent to the hotel. The only word to describe this landscape  is "gorgeous"!
