Bergen treated us very well today! The guys toured the historic area of Bryggen, the heart of medieval Bergen. We say the Bergenhus Fortress, the Rosenkrantz Tower, and Mariakirken  , which dates back to the 12th century. After a dinner at our hotel, we made our way over to the concert venue, where we sang with two different female choirs. They were wonderful, and they seemed to like us as well! Tears were shed as some of the guys sang their final concert with the Glee Club. The camaraderie is very strong among the guys, and even though we will be happy to be home to see friends and family, we will all miss and cherish the time we have spent together in Iceland and Norway! Brothers Sing on! #TourXIX
