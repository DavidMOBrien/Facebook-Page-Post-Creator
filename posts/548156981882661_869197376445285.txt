For this week's Meet the Glee Club, we have Derrick Bertram!

Expected Graduation Date: May 2015
Major/Minors: Theatre
How many semesters have you been in the Glee Club: 5
What part do you sing: Tenor 1

What do you like the most about Glee Club: Five words...Glee Club Christmas Variety Show!  Getting to sing in front of a sold out GBPAC is an amazing experience.  It really gets me into the holiday season!  Also, whenever I see the audience smiles after the show, it makes me smile because I know that we as a group just made their day or night!  Speaking of which, have you ordered tickets yet?  If not, what are you waiting for, Christmas? (haha, see what I did there?)
 
What is your favorite memory from Glee Club:  Going to Spain with the Glee Club!  It was my very first time flying and my first time traveling outside of the United States!  From a cultural perspective, one of my favorite parts of the Spain trip was watching the bull fights in Madrid!
  
What's your favorite food: Spaghetti
