Reminder: we will be having our first meeting tomorrow at 6:00PM in the GBPAC Great Hall! Refer to the map in this post if you have concerns about finding the correct building. GBPAC is marked with the Red Circle in the bottom-right corner.
There will be more than enough space to maintain a social distance in the Great Hall, and you will be able to hear how the Glee Club plans to operate this upcoming semester!

Brothers Sing On!
