Our next Senior Spotlight is on Zachary Chaplain! Zachary is a Baritone from Bettendorf, Iowa, and is pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems here at UNI.

Zachary's plans after graduation are to work full time in the Midwest or in Colorado, preferably in the area of project management or computer networking. He would really enjoy working in the theatrical lighting industry.

One of Zachary's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club took place in Iceland during the 2016 European Tour.
"Singing for an audience of 15 at the Skalholt Church in Skalholt, Iceland. The audience may have been small, but I have never felt a stronger connection to the guys than I did at that exact moment. After the concert, we all walked outside, joined hands, and sang Brothers Sing On. The setting was absolutely breathtaking, and at that moment, I knew I was part of something much larger than myself."
