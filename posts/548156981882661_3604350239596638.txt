The Glee Club is proud to be an unaudtioned choir, which in turn means the majority of Glee Club singers are non-voice majors!

Because of this, we have started development on a wide variety of specialized projects that allow multiple singers to contribute to the Glee Club in ways that only their majors and their experiences give them the capabilities to!

We are so excited to share these projects with you in the coming months, but for now please enjoy another song from Monday night that you might recognize from our Christmas Shows!
