Our own Justin Kime was warm-hearted and went out of his way to get to know many of his fellow Glee Clubbers. To all people who knew and loved Justin, our hearts are with you.

Justin's Memorial Service will be held tomorrow, February 22, at 1pm in St. Bernard's Catholic Church, Stewartville MN. (Visitation is 11am-1pm on the same day in the same location.) Members of the Glee Club will be traveling to sing at the service and celebrate Justin's life.
