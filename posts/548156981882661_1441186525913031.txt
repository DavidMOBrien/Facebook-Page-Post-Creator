Our next Senior Spotlight is on Anthony Perez! Anthony is a Baritone from San Antonio, Texas, and is pursuing a degree in psychology here at UNI.

Anthony's plans after graduation are still a little undecided. He will be interviewing for graduate assistanships, as well as full-time positions in student affairs. He would like to work in a collegiate setting, but he is unsure if he will work full time immediately, or if he will attend grad school first.

One of Anthony's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club was performing in the 2016 Christmas Variety Show.
"This was my first year in the Glee Club and I have loved every moment of it. However, I would say that my favorite memory would be performing in the Christmas Variety show. Being from San Antonio, Texas, I do not usually have the privilege of having my 
family come to concerts to support me. However, for this concert, my dad was able to make the trip up, and see me perform!"
