On Saturday May 12th at 6:00 PM, the UNI Varsity Men's Glee Club will be hosting a concert at the Hyde Park Union Church in Chicago! Anyone who is interested in attending is more than welcome join us! The concert should last for about one hour. 

This will be our "send off" concert, as the following day we are departing for Dublin, Ireland from the O'Hare International Airport.
