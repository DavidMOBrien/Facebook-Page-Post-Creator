The members of the Glee Club have some amazing news! We are partnering up again with the Northeast Iowa Food Bank and will be collecting non-perishable food items at all three Christmas Variety Show performances!

Help us and the Northeast Iowa Food Bank by bringing non-perishable food items when you come to watch the Christmas Variety Show. Last year we collected 650 pounds of food, with your help we can easily double that number!
