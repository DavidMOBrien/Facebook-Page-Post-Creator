We would like to thank everyone who attended our concert in Chicago last night! It was amazing to see so many Glee Club alumni, as they joined us in singing "Brothers, Sing On!" on stage. This weekend was an excellent opportunity to explore the city.

Our next stop is Dublin, Ireland, including a visit to the Guinness Storehouse tomorrow evening!
