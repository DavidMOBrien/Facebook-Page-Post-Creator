The next Senior Spotlight is on Alexander Wilkening! Alex is a music composition and computer science major and he is from Knoxville, Iowa. When he graduates he plans on working as a programmer and finding work in the music field. He sings tenor one in the Glee Club and is currently in his 7th semester with the group! 

Alex said that his favorite Glee Club memory was "The first time I went to the OP with the Glee Club. Listening to other Glee Clubbers tell stories and making more friends in two hours than I had made in my entire first semester of college were truly memorable!"

Thanks for your dedication to the group, Alex! Best of luck to you down the road!
