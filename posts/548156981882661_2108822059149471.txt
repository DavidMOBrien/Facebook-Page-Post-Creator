Hi everyone! We've recently learned that a 3rd party vendor has scooped up some Christmas Variety Show tickets and is selling them for $43 each! Please don't purchase tickets anywhere other than a Glee Clubber or  https://unitix.uni.edu/. Tickets should cost $14 (or $16.75 if you buy online).

[The ARMISTICE program on 11/11, however, does have a graduated ticket cost due to the program's inclusion on the Gallagher Bluedorn Artist Series.]
