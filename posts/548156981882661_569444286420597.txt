Join us for The Seventh Annual Brothers Sing On Golf Classic! It starts at 9:00 am, Saturday, April 27th (tomorrow) at Fox Ridge in Dike, Iowa.  The Golf Classic features fun, food, and golf. It's also an opportunity for current members of the Glee Club to celebrate the end of the school year. (And alumni are always looking for an excuse to ditch yard work on a Saturday!) This is a best-ball style event, so even if you are a horrible golfer, someone on your team will pick up the slack. Green fees and cart are just $28. See you there!
