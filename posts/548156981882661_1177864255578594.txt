After landing in Bergen, the group traveled by bus through the mountains and valleys of Norway. The views were breathtaking, and the natural beauty was almost overwhelming. We made it to Kinsarvik around 7:30, and are currently enjoying a wonderful 3 course dinner while overlooking the beautiful fjord! #TourXIX
