Last night we celebrated the end of another semester by awarding members who have given significant time to the Glee Club for 7 semesters and allowing our graduating Seniors to speak.

Thank you to Cole and Damond for sharing your journeys with us all! You have inspired your Brothers in Song through your leadership and dedication to the Glee Club. We wish you both the best!
