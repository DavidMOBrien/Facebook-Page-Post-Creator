Our next Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Jess Larison! Jess is studying Social Studies Education and is from La Porte City, Iowa. After graduation, he plans on teaching U.S. history or government in the Midwest. He sings Tenor II for the Glee Club and has been with us for 7 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said "My favorite Glee Club memories were made on our 2018 tour to Ireland and Wales. The best was when several of us woke up at 4:00 am on our last day in Wales and hiked to the top of a seaside hill in Llandudno. We watched the sunrise over the ocean and sang several songs (which can probably be found on the Glee Club Instagram). It was the perfect ending to our tour."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Jess!
