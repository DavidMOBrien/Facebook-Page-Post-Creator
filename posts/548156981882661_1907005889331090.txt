A day well spent on our last night in Wales.

The Glee Club started their day in the town of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwll-llantysiliogogogoch, Wales. That is correct! The longest named town in the world. 

Following this extraordinary visit, we stormed the Beaumaris Castle! This unique site had a moat surrounding it's walls and was a joy to see. 

We had our last concert tonight in St. Mary's Church Caernarfon with the Caernarfon Male Voice Choir. It was a great evening. Welsh choirs can sing like no other. It was an honor to perform with the group.
