Let's take a look at Talon Lamb for our next Senior Spotlight! Talon (right) is studying Management Information Systems | Supply Chain Management and is from Toledo, IA. After graduation, he plans to live in Ireland, earning his Six Sigma Green Belt in Quality. Following this achievement, he intends to work and travel. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 7 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite memory was when I woke up at 4 am with other Glee Clubbers and to see the sunrise on our last day in Wales."

Thank you, Talon, for all you have done for the group. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
