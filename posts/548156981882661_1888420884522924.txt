What a year! The Glee Club would like to thank you all for your kind support. Our hopes are that we lifted up, inspired, and made this world a better place.

We hosted our annual banquet Monday, thanking our seniors and reflecting upon the wonderful year we have had together.

Our next stop is: IRELAND & WALES.
We will depart from Chicago Sunday, May 13th and arrive in Dublin the following morning!  

Stay tuned for more details regarding our international tour.
