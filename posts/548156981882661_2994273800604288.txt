Our next Senior Spotlight is on Jeremy Abels! Jeremy is majoring in Biology and is from Durant, Iowa. After graduation, he plans on obtaining a Ph.D. in evolutionary or developmental biology. He sings Tenor I and has been in the Glee Club for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite Glee Club memory is when we went to Albia, Iowa for a concert my Sophomore year. I remember how much it meant to the people there that the Glee Club had come and how much they enjoyed our performance. It really made me proud to be a part of this group."

Thank you, Jeremy. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
