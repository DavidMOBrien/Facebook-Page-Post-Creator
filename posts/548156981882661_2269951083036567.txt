Our next Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Marvin Ojoh! Marvin is studying Computer Science and is from Lyon, France and Asaba, Nigeria. After graduation, his plans are to find work in Computer Science. He sings Tenor II for the Glee Club and has been with us for 7 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "The spring of 2016 tour to Minnesota was my favorite memory."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Marvin!
