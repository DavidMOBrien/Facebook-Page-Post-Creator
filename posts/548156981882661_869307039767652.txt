The UNI Varsity Men's Glee Club purchased a new set for the Christmas Variety Show last year. This could not have been accomplished without donations from outside of the Glee Club. Donations to the Glee Club help offset the cost of our tuxedos and rugby jerseys that we wear during performances, as well as helping with the many trips we do across Iowa and internationally.

Thanks to donations from alumni and the community at large, the Glee Club has been able to accomplish many great things and help the community in return. 
Help out the Glee Club by donating to our fundraising campaign. Any amount helps.
