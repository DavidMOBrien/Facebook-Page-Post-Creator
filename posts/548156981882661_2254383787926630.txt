Welcome back! Our first rehearsal of the semester is in the books and we are looking forward to a spectacular year.

It's not too late to join the Glee Club! We meet on Monday and Wednesday evenings at 6:00pm in the Gallagher Bluedorn Performing Arts Center. Stop by and check it out! We would be thrilled to see you there.

We have many great plans in store this Spring and hope to lift up, inspire, and make your world a better place!
