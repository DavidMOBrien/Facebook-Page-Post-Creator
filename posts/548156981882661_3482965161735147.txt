All returning members and people interested in joining the Glee Club for this semester: we will be having our first "practice" this coming Monday ( August 17th ) in the GBPAC Great Hall at 6:00PM to explain how we will function this fall semester. 
In the Great Hall, we will be able to be spread out and maintain appropriate social distance between members. We look forward to seeing you there!

Brothers Sing On!
