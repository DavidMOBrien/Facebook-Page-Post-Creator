Our next senior spotlight of the semester is on Daniel Janssen! Daniel is studying Accounting and is from Vinton, IA. After graduation, he plans on working in the Tax Department of BerganKDV in Waterloo. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 9 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite Glee Club memory was taking a small train to the top of Mt. Snowdon during our international tour to Ireland and Wales. It was a breathtaking view that I will never forget."

Below is a picture of Daniel on the peak of that mountain. Thank you for sharing, Daniel! We appreciate all you have done for this ensemble and wish you the best of luck going forward.
