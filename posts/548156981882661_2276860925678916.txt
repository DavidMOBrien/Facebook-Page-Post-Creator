Alec Walker hits the stage for this week's Senior Spotlight! Alec is majoring in MIS (Management Information Systems) and is from Bettendorf, Iowa. He sings Tenor II for the Glee Club and has been with us for 11 semesters!

Some of Alec's favorite Glee Club memories include touring and singing in all the beautiful cathedrals of Spain, Ireland, and Wales. 

We appreciate all your hard work, Alec. Thank you for making this world a better place!
