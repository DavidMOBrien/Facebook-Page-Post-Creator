Attention, Glee Club Alumni:
We will be hosting a homecoming tailgate THIS WEEKEND!

Look for the large "Glee Club shield" flag as early as 8 AM on Saturday in the B-parking lot by the UNIdome. Burgers, hotdogs, brats, and chips will be served. Join us in celebrating 100 years of Panther homecomings.

BSO!
