That Friday feeling when you wake up and remember the Glee Club has a concert tonight! We won't be wearing tutus tonight, but we will be just as goofy! Join us tonight in Lang Hall Auditorium at 6 PM for our Welcome Home Concert! We suggest a donation of $3 dollars with all proceeds going to the Northeast Iowa Food Bank! See ya there!
