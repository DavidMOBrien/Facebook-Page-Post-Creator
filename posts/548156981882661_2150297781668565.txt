Our next Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Nate Weber! Nate is majoring in General Studies and is from Waukee, Iowa. He sings Tenor 2 for the Glee Club and has been with us for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "I do not have a specific favorite memory, but I love being a part of a group that builds towards something bigger than we could create individually. I have met good friends along the way."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Nate!
