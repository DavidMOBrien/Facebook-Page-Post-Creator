Last night we had the pleasure of working with recent Glee Clubber and UNI graduate, Will Lubaroff. Will was an outstanding member of the group, also being the original director of The SingPins. Will now teaches at Dunkerton High School, where he is surely doing a wonderful job. It was an honor having him conduct our rehearsal. Thanks, Will!
