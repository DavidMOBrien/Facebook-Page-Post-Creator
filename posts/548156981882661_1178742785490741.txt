Today, the Glee Club embarked on a cruise of the beautiful Hardangerfjord. The group made a stop in a beautiful village on the shore, toured the Hardangervidda Nature Preserve, and then returned to the boat to continue on to Norheimsund. There, the guys gave a joint concert with Kor I Alle Dager, a wonderful female choir. After a fun filled bus ride back to Kinsarvik, a few of the guys decided to go for a "refreshing" dip in the fjord, which lasted all of 30 seconds. All that said, we are ready to tour Bergen tomorrow! #TourXIX
