What do you like most about the Glee Club: I've always enjoyed listening to Men's Choirs because of the richness of tone they can produce.  Being able to participate in that is a wonderful feeling.  The camaraderie between all of the men in the Glee Club is also a favorite part.  I have made many friends here at UNI thanks to the Glee Club, and I'm always meeting more people.

What is your favorite memory of the Glee Club? A favorite memory is a tough thing to choose.  All of the Christmas Shows, and going on tour in Germany and Austria are extremely memorable for me.  It might be easier to pick something that everyone else will remember, and that is when I was a left on a mountain in Germany.  I'm sure that tale will be told for quite some time.

Favorite food? Favorite food is also tough, I would have to say potatoes.  I have yet to meet a potato that I did not like.
