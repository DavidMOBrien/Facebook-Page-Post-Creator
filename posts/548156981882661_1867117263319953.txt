Our next Senior Spotlight is on Clay Olson! Clay is studying Leisure, Youth, and Human Services: Tourism and Nonprofit Management and is from Hopkinton, Iowa. After graduation Clay just wants to find happiness wherever they end up. Clay sings tenor 2 in the group and is in the third semester with the Glee Club. 

Clay said his favorite memory with the Glee Club was "At the Glee Club Christmas Variety Show. We were finally lined up  waiting to go on stage. Every Glee Club member was nervous, but also excited as they were surrounded by their Brothers. All the different colored lights combined with the cheers from the audience create a natural high that can turn your worst stage fright to pure confidence. We ran on stage into the blinding light and sang a fun, crazy, boisterous song to get the crowd going; then later transitioned into a song that melted everyone to their core. That would be my favorite Glee Club memory; the power our music has on the emotions of each person in the audience feeling magnified by each singer on stage. Thank you Glee Club."

Thanks a ton to you, Clay, and we wish you the best of luck in the future!
