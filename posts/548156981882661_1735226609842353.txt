The next Senior Spotlight is on Tyler Dursky! Tyler is an Environmental and Earth Science major from Oskaloosa, Iowa. After graduation he plans on working in conservation and natural resource management with the EPA, DNR, or within the private sector.  

Tyler is in his 7th semester with the Glee Club and he sings Tenor 2 with the group. When asked about his favorite Glee Club memories Tyler replied, "Some of my favorite memories in the Glee Club include the Christmas shows, seminar at the Other Place, Arthur Murder, singing in the Ave Maria small group, and traveling to the Mall of America where we sang Brothers Sing On on the roller coaster. However, the memories I will cherish the most will be singing in St. Mary's Basilica in Minneapolis, the tour to Iceland and Norway, the boat ride through the fjords of Norway, and singing the Gaudete solo in Skalholt, Iceland, where all brothers stood together in a circle with the vast expanse of nature surrounding them."

Tyler has done much for the Glee Club and we thank him and wish him the best of luck!
