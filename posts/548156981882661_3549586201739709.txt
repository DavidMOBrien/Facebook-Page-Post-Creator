First-Year Spotlight

We have more First-Year Glee Clubbers to introduce to all of you!

This is Aaron Burger from Grimes, Iowa! He is a Political Science Major that learned about the Glee Club from watching our Christmas Show during his college visit!

He is enthusiastic to get involved in the comradery and brotherhood within the Glee Club, and we are happy to welcome him!

Hope you enjoy your time with us, Aaron!
