We are devastated by the tragic deaths of our own Justin Kime and our friend Tristan Marlow. 

Tonight (Monday, Feb 18) we will hold a vigil for both Justin and Tristan at the Campanile at 6:45pm. All are welcome. 

Grieving takes support. To all UNI students, please know that the university has people in place to offer support. You can go to the Counseling Center during the day for an emergency appointment on a walk in basis — no appointment needed. You can also call the Counseling Center (319) 273 - 2676 at any time and press #2 to speak with a counselor on the phone.

We believe in the power of music to lift up, inspire, and help make the world a better place. Justin and Tristan did that for all of us and we are grateful for their lives, their wisdom, and their friendship.
