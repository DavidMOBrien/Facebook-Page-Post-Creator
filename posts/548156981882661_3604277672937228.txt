Last night the Glee Club was able to go into the parking garage and all sing together for the first time this semester. We were masked, 10ft+ distanced, and only sang for about 5 minutes — but it reminded us again of how much we love singing together and how much we love the Glee Club. This is our first time through Brothers Sing On this semester. It’s not perfect — but it might be the most beautiful it’s ever sounded to us!
