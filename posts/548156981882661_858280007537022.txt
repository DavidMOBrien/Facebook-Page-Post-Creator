What do you like best about the Glee Club? The connection that I have not only to the current members of the Glee Club, but to the Alumni of the group and to anyone who has ever attended a performance or supported the Glee Club.

What is your favorite memory from Glee Club? The Glee Club has quite literally given me the world.  I can't pick a specific moment that I would identify as my favorite memory, but I'm sure that it would be something from one of our international tours...that or "Mambo Santa Mambo" last year, who knew Santa could dance so well?
Favorite Food? Can I say all food?
