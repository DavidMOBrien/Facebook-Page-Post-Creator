This week's Senior Spotlight is on Sam King! Sam (front center) is studying Digital Media Leadership and is from Des Moines, IA. After graduation, he plans on moving back to Des Moines to pursue a career in copywriting. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "About four years ago I joined the Glee Club. It was my first semester at UNI, and at this point, I was questioning whether college was right for me and if the Glee Club was something I should bother with. A recent string of student deaths didn't help me out either. In response to the recent, tragic events, the Glee Club decided to attend a vigil that was being held for one of the students. When we arrived, we sang Ave Maria.

That night made me realize why I was in the Glee Club. Uplifting, inspiring, and helping make the world a better place is why I am in this group."

Thank you for sharing, Sam! We appreciate all you have done for this ensemble and wish you the best of luck going forward!
