Fall semester of 2019 is in full effect! For a few Glee Clubbers, this is their last semester with the ensemble. We appreciate all they have done for the group and feel they deserve to be recognized. Today begins our Senior Spotlight series!

Our first Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Nic Peiffer! Nic is studying Elementary and Middle-Level Education and is from Troy Mills, Iowa. After graduation, he plans on teaching the youth of America. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 6 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite memory was from our international tour in Dublin when we sang with a Welsh choir at the Teachers Club."

Well said, Nic. Thank you for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future!
