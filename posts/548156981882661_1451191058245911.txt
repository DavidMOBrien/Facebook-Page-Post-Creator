Our next Senior Spotlight is on Nate Miller! Nathan (Nate) is a Tenor 2 from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and is pursuing a degree in Economics here at UNI.

Nate's plans after graduation are to work in the field of Market Research Analysis, and eventually pursue a graduate degree!

One of Nate's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club took place during the Christmas Variety Show this past December. "On my final Christmas show, being allowed the opportunity to sing Oh Christmas Tree as part of the "Junior Varsity Men's Glee Club" meant a lot to me. Having that one last opportunity to sing with my brothers in song will always stick with me."
