Our first Senior Spotlight of this semester is on Justin Moody! Justin is studying psychology and communication studies and is from Manson, Iowa. After graduation he plans on attending graduate school for school counseling. He sings baritone in the Glee Club and has been with us for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said "I have made so many great memories with the Glee Club that I can't pick one. These range from my first Christmas show to singing internationally (Iceland, Norway, and soon to be Ireland and Wales). All of these memories I have are because of the great people that I get to spend time with on every Monday and Wednesday."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Justin!
