Our last Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Garrett Freeman! Garrett is studying Interactive Digital Studies and Computer Science. He is from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. After graduation, he plans on working as a software engineer in the Cedar Falls area. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 5 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite memory was doing my very first Christmas show. It really showed me what the glee club was about and reminded me of why I joined. When I first saw the Christmas show 3 years ago, with never having been in a choir before, I remember thinking to myself "that is what I need to do, I need to be a part of the UNI Varsity Men's Glee Club." So I joined and it was everything I expected it to be and more. With all that in mind, seeing the show come together that year was incredible and I couldn't be happier with the decision of joining the group." 

Well said, Garrett. Thank you for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future!
