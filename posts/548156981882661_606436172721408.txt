Shout Out to our Glee Club Members who helped out the Varsity Men's Glee Club at this year's Student Involvement Fair for Summer Orientation.  They talked to many interested freshmen this year.  If you know of a guy at UNI that is not part of the Glee Club, there is still time for them to sign-up for the Fall Semester.  Brothers Sing On!
