Our last Senior Spotlight is on Nick Johnson! Nick is majoring in Biology and is from Humboldt, Iowa. After graduation, he plans on getting a job in a biology lab. He sings Tenor II and has been in the Glee Club for 8 semesters!

His favorite Glee Club memory is when he got to sing in a Welsh castle in May of 2018.

Thank you, Nick. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
