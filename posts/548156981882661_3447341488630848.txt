Fall Semester is approaching fast, classes will be in session soon, and many things are uncertain in these unfamiliar times. However, the UNI Varsity Men's Glee Club will continue to believe in the power of music to lift up, inspire, and make the world a better place in a time where it is needed most.

If you or anybody you know would like to join a club of roughly a hundred great guys, you can sign up for the Glee Club on MyUNIVerse with the course code MUS ENS 1100-05 ( No singing experience needed, we are an UNAUDITIONED ensemble! )

If you are still indecisive on joining the Glee Club, or have additional questions, feel free to contact us on any of our social media platforms or reach out to our Head of Recruitment Josh Dvorak at dvorajac@uni.edu

Brothers Sing On!
