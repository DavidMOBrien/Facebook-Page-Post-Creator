Our next Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Aaron Anderson! Aaron is studying physics and is from Dallas Center, Iowa. After graduation, he has plans to start working in industry. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 4 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite moment with the Glee club was running through the aisles of the Great Hall for my very first Christmas Show performance."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Aaron!
