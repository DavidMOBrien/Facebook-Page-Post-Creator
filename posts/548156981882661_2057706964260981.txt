#TBT 
Here are a few great photos from our Welcome Home Concert on Friday! Thank you again for attending.
Last night, the glee clubbers followed rehearsal with pizza at the OP, a long-standing Glee Club tradition. It was a great opportunity for the guys to get to know each other.
We are eager to perform again for our amazing fans!
