The Glee Club is striving to generate funds which will be added to the Les Hale Endowment fund. These funds will stay within the Glee Club to contribute to different projects and expenditures for years to come. Money from the Les Hale Endowment fund has helped to do many things. It has helped the Men's Glee Club to: construct our new set, purchase new tuxedos, offer international tour scholarships to students in the Glee Club, cover travel expenses and bus rentals, and keep participation in the Men's Glee Club free of cost to all performers.

We believe in the power of music to lift up, inspire and make the world a better place. With help from the supporters of the Men's Glee Club we hope to continue to promote this mission on campus, throughout the state of Iowa, and all over the world.
