Today we acknowledge Kyle Hobt in our next Senior Spotlight! Kyle is studying Communications and is from Des Moines, IA. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 7 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "Being able to participate in two different international tours with the glee club has been such an incredible experience. I have had the opportunity to share music and culture with people that have influenced me in so many ways beyond words. I've definitely made some of my best friends in this group, and for that, I will be forever grateful."

Thank you, Kyle, for your dedication to the Glee Club. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
