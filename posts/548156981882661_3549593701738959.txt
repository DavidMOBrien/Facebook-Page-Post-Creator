First-Year Spotlight

We would also like to welcome Joseph Correa to the Glee Club!

Joseph is a Biology / Biochemistry Major from Clive, Iowa! He heard about the Glee Club from Josh Dvorack and Owen Lerg who Glee Clubbers he knew that encouraged him to join us. Joseph is excited to meet new people and make music within the Glee Club.

Nice to meet you, Joseph!
