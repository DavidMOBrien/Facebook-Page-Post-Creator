The Glee Club believes in the power of music to lift up, inspire, and help make the world a better place. As a group of 115+ guys, we recognize that we have the ability to make a big difference.

Tonight, we invited Dr. Alan Heisterkamp to lead us through an interactive presentation on "Demonstrating Leadership in our Spheres of Influence". Dr. Heisterkamp is the director of the Mentors in Violence Prevention Leadership Institute. This seminar dealt with violence prevention. Violence comes in a whole array of types, and each one is a serious health concern. We learned how to recognize and prevent violence around us. We started out in one large group, and then split off into smaller groups to discuss individual situations. We learned a lot.

Together, we can all make a difference. Do not be afraid to speak out, and actively take part in violence prevention!
