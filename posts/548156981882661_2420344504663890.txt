A gentleman approached me after our performance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. He introduced himself as a UNI grad from the 1970’s, and a drummer in the UNI Jazz program under Jim Coffin. He said, “That was absolutely wonderful. I have spent the last 40 years living in Los Angeles and New York. THIS is why I came back to Cedar Falls, Iowa.”

He was clearly moved by our performance.

In this current time of division and fear in the world, Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’ resonates with the transformative power of joy, universal freedom and embrace of all mankind, through the art of music. “Alle Menschen warden Brüder” (All people become brothers).
It was a message we all need to hear.

It was an honor to be part of the message—to lift up, inspire and help make the world a better place, through the power of music. It’s what the UNI Varsity Men’s Glee Club has always been about.

Brothers Sing On!
