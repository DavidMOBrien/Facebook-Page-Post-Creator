Our next Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Brandt Roskens! Brandt (front-center) is studying Vocal Music Education and is from Spencer, Iowa. He is the current director of our a cappella group, the SingPins, and does an excellent job with the small ensemble. After graduation, he plans on teaching in northwest Iowa. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 7 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "My favorite memory was whisper-singing Brothers Sing On in a hot, stinky, cramped hotel room in Europe at 1:00 in the morning. We were worried about waking the random neighbors (as if they hadn't already had enough of 60 loud and obnoxious Americans)."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Brandt!
