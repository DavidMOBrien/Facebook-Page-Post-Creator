What do you like most about Glee Club:  I like that a bunch of guys from different backgrounds and areas of study can come together, just hang out, and make awesome music together all while getting to know each other and becoming good friends.

What is your favorite memory from the Glee Club:  My favorite memory with the Glee Club would have to be singing Ave Maria in this little church in the middle of a cemetery in Vienna while we were there for the European tour to Germany and Austria.  Something about the way it sounded that time was really special, and I don't think I'll ever forget that.

What's your favorite food: Pepperoni pizza: simple but amazing
