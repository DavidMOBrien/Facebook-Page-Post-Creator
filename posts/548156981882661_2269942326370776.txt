Spring semester of 2019 is in full effect! For many Glee Clubbers, this is their last semester with the ensemble. We appreciate all they have done for the group and feel they deserve to be recognized. Today begins our Senior Spotlight series!

Our first Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Joe Kruger! Joe is studying Elementary Education and is from Slater, Iowa. His plans for the future are to finish student teaching in the fall of 2019. After graduation, he plans on finding a teaching position anywhere that hires. He sings Tenor I for the Glee Club and has been with us for 5 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "Our run-out to Albia, IA was my favorite Glee Club memory. It was crazy to see a community fill up an old opera house just because the Glee club was coming to town."

Well said, Joe. Thank you for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future!
