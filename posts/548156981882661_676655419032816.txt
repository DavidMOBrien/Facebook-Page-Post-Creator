"We Believe in the Power of Music to Lift up, Inspire, and Help Make the World a Better Place"  

This is the mission of the The UNI Varsity Men's Glee Club.  We are grateful to partner with the Northeast Iowa Food Bank for the 36th Annual Christmas Variety Show.  If you can, please bring a non-perishable food item to donate before each show.  Thank you for helping us to Lift up, Inspire, and Make this World a Better place.  Brothers, Sing On!
