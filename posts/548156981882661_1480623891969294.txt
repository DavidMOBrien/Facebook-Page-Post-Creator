Our next Senior Spotlight is on Randy Wells! Randy is a Baritone from Winterset, Iowa, and is pursuing a degree in Music Composition here at UNI.

Randy's plans after graduation are to do freelance composition work in the classical music world, with the grandiose aspiration of becoming the next Beethoven.

One of Randy's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club took place in Spain during the 2014 European Tour.
"When we were singing Ave Maria in an ancient cathedral in spain, there was a divine thunder clap during the quiet third verse. I was moved to tears.  The harmony of nature, music, and the sacred space was unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Afterwards, I got to exchange tearful hugs with concert-goers and ensemble brothers who were just as affected by these musical moments as I was."
