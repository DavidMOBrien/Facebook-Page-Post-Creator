Our next Senior Spotlight is on Kazek Israni-Winger! Kazek is majoring in Digital Production and is from Grimes, Iowa. After graduation, he will be trying to get into fiction film-making. He sings Tenor I and has been in the Glee Club for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "Every single Christmas concert. I love those experiences and nothing compares."

Thank you, Kazek. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
