Our next Senior Spotlight is on Chase Pryor! Chase is majoring in Movement & Excercise Science and is from Waterloo, Iowa. After graduation, he's deciding on whether to be a personal trainer, to continue his schooling, or to travel and live out of state. Regardless, he wants to continue his passion for singing/songwriting. He sings Tenor II and has been in the Glee Club for 6 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "I have so many “favorite” Glee Club memories: Listening to Steve and Paul tell stories and sing drinking songs at a Pub in Dublin, Ireland, night life with the boys on tour, Dr. Wiles stealing my bag in Ireland, walking the streets in Chicago, Dublin, Chester, and Wales and listening to all the street artists, riding the trolly with the guys after leaving Copper Face Jacks in Dublin, getting to play in the Glee Club band, going on a SingPins tour/road trip, singing the UNI Almomater very high in the wrong key with the SingPins at a scholarship banquet because Bryce insisted on using his pitch pipe, recording in the studio with the SingPins to make our CD, every time Dr. Wiles did/said something goofy or funny and the room lit up with laughter, the first time I met with Tristen to show him my ideas for We, the Wolves and being so excited and thankful that it was all really happening, the first time I listened to what Tristen made We, the Wolves into, the first time I held sheet music for a song I wrote just sitting there listening to all the guys sing it, performing in both Christmas Variety Shows and especially dancing in Arthur Murder with the guys in my last show. I’ll just stop there because I could keep going. The list is never-ending, to be honest. I’m really glad I joined the Glee Club and made so many great memories with amazing people. I can’t wait to make more in Vietnam! "

Thank you, Chase. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
