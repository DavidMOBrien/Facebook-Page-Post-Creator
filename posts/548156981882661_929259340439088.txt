Tuesday's Meet the Glee Club member is Ethan Clark!

Graduation Date: May 2015
Major: Criminology and Sociology with a minor in Spanish

This is my fourth semester in Glee Club
Voice Part: Bass

What I love the most about Glee club is that it doesn't matter if we really know each other or not every time I see a fellow Glee clubber around campus or anywhere there's always a head nod, or a smile.
My favorite memory from Glee Club is playing Jack Frost in the Glee Club play during the Christmas Show my freshman year.

My favorite food is smoked ribs.
