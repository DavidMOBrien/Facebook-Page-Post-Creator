It is almost time for our Welcome Home Concert! If you have ever wanted 135 strapping young men to sing to you tomorrow is your lucky day! Join us at 6 PM Friday night in Lang Hall Auditorium! The concert is free but we encourage a $3 dollar donation with all proceeds going to the Northeast Iowa Food Bank!
