Our next Senior Spotlight is on Nick Croston! Nick is studying economics and he is from Sioux City, Iowa. After graduation Nick is moving to Rochester, MN to work for IBM. After gaining some experience he plans on going back to grad school and then moving south to avoid the cold winters of Iowa. He sings bass in the group and is in his 8th semester in the Glee Club.

When asked what his favorite Glee Club memory Nick replied "One of my favorite memories is being undefeated against Jotham Polashek in cribbage in Iceland. Additionally, another one of my favorite (and terrifying) memories in Glee Club is when we were on the way home from Iceland/Norway trip. There was the possibility of missing our flight in Keflavik, Iceland (taking us back to the US) due to delays in Norway. On the flight into Keflavik, Iceland, I turn to my plane seating partner, Dr. Wiles presenting him with the possibility a bunch of American dudes might have to spend the night in the Keflavik, Iceland airport without a director. Once we landed, Dr. Wiles and a few seniors would be leaving the Iceland airport because they had planned to extend the trip by staying in Iceland a few extra days. He turned to me, handed me the Glee Club credit card, shrugged, and said, 'Eh, no reason to worry. Buy the Glee Club some pizza and catch the next flight to the US.' He proceeded to tell me life is too short to concern yourself with minute issues. All would be well in that situation, and everyone would end up getting home safe. Aside from the lifelong friendships, countless laughing at the guys in the back of the baritone section, and beautiful music making, Dr. Wiles has built a phenomenal reputation with the men of the Varsity Men's Glee Club as being a leader, mentor, and friend. This, along with many other cherished memories, make my experiences in the Glee Club invaluable to me."

Thanks for all you have done for the Glee Club and best of luck in the future, Nick!
