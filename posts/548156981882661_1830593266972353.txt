Our next Senior Spotlight is on Doug Kennedy! Doug is a supply chain management major from Clinton, Iowa. Once he graduates he plans on working in a logistics or operations department in eastern or central Iowa. Doug has been in the Glee Club for 8 semester and sings bass with the group. 

Doug says that his favorite Glee Club memory "Was performing in the Arthur Murder dance in the 2017 Christmas Show. I was very glad to take myself out of my comfort zone to be apart of that traditional dance! I felt that I developed a great sense of camaraderie with the members in that group!" 

Thanks for all of your hard work in the group and best of luck in the future, Doug!
