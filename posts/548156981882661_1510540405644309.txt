Our next Senior Spotlight is on Avery Hubbard! Avery is a Baritone from Mason City, Iowa, and is pursuing degrees in Criminology and Sociology here at UNI.

Avery's plans after graduation are to go into law enforcement. He plans on getting a job as a police officer or a deputy sheriff.

One of Avery's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club took place during the trip to Minneapolis last year.
"On our trip to Minneapolis, we stayed overnight, and then sang a concert the next evening. It was a lot of fun, and very interesting, to spend time with so many brothers in song.  Singing at St, Mary's Basilica on this trip was also a once in a lifetime experience. It was unique to sing in there."
