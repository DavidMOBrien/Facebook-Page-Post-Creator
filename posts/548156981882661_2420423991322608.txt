We have one more Senior Spotlight for you! We would like to recognize Christopher Merck for all of his dedicated work. Christopher is majoring in Math Education, Political Communication, and is minoring in History. He is from Marion, IA. After graduation he plans to student teach, find employment, and later attend graduate school. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 6 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "When we were in Wales, we had just finished a concert with a Welsh Women's choir, and we discovered that it was their director's birthday. We then sang a bilingual Happy Birthday, with the Glee Club singing in English and the Welsh choir singing the same tune in Welsh. It was so cool to hear that."

Thank you, Christopher. We appreciate all you have done for this ensemble and wish you the best of luck going forward!
