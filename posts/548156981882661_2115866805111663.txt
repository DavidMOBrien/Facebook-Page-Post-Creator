Our first Senior Spotlight of the semester is on Mitch Leonard from Clinton, Iowa! Mitch is studying Public Relations and Interactive Digital Studies. After graduation, he plans on going into social media management and digital advertising. He sings Tenor I for the Glee Club and has been with us for 9 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said "I will never forget the feeling during my first Christmas Variety Show when we turned out to the audience for an applause after We Need a Little Christmas. It was the pinnacle of 115 guys putting their hearts and souls into rehearsing for the last four months. That memory still gives me goosebumps and it's at that moment when I realized that UNI was my home."

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Mitch!
