As our trip comes to a close, the guys prepare for one more stop; Troldhaugen, or the "Hill of Trolls". This was the home of Norway's most famous composer, Edvard Grieg. This man wrote many great pieces of music, but the one that means the most to the Glee Club is entitled "Brothers Sing On". This has been the theme of the Glee Club for its entire existence. We are very excited to sing this music in the land it was created in. 

After visiting his home, we will return to Bergen, head to the airport, and begin our long journey home. Brothers Sing On! #TourXIX
