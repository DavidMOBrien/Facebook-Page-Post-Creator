Our next senior spotlight is on Adam Sitzmann! Adam is studying Interactive Digital Studies and is from Kingsley, IA. After graduation, he plans on finding work and staying in the Midwest. He sings Tenor II for the Glee Club and has been with us for 10 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "There are too many memories count at the moment. Glee Club has been the defining part of my college experience, so naturally, I have so many amazing memories. Since I'm not able to choose a favorite, I'll just list one of them.

After we sang our last concert on the Ireland & Wales tour, it was a fairly emotional moment for a lot of us. Amidst the hugging, crying, and camaraderie, we circled up and sang "Brothers Sing On" as we have so many times before. We overlooked the ocean afterward. Sitting on the stone wall with my fellow brothers in song was the perfect way to end a perfect trip.  "

Thanks for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future, Adam!
