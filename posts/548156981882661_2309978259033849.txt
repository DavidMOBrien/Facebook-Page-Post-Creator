Friends, thank you to everyone who came to the Vigil last night to remember Justin and Tristan. We have just learned that Justin Kime's Memorial Service will be held this Friday, February 22 at 1pm in St. Bernard's Catholic Church, Stewartsville MN. (Visitation is 11am-1pm on the same day in the same location.) Members of the Glee Club will be busing up to Stewartsville together on that day to sing at the service and celebrate Justin's life.
