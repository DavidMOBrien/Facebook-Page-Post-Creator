What do you like most about the Glee Club: I love the traditions and camaraderie of the glee club. It's truly unlike any other organization I've ever been a part of. The brotherhood that the glee club brings, and it's passion for making great music is awe-inspiring. Coming to rehearsals on Mondays and Wednesdays is something I always look forward to. It's one of the best and most rewarding ensembles I've ever been involved in.

Being a part of a glee club tradition, sharing our music with people overseas, and becoming closer and forming life-long friendships with my Brothers in Song was the greatest experience of my life.
