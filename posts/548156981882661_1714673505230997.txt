Our next Senior Spotlight is on Will Lubaroff! Will is a Music Education major from Iowa City, Iowa, and after graduation he plans on being a music teacher. He is currently in his 9th semester in the Glee Club and he sings baritone. 

Will has been very involved with the Glee Club and is currently in charge of The SingPins, a smaller ensemble within the Glee Club. His favorite Glee Club memory was when he went on tour to Iceland and Norway and witnessed fellow Glee Clubber Kaleb Olson dunk on some Norwegian kids. What a memory to have! 

Thanks for all you have done and best of luck!
