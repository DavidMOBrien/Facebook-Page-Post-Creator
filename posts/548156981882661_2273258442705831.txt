For this week's Senior Spotlight we would like to recognize our current chairman, Daniel Hanson. Dan is studying History at UNI and is from Sioux City, IA. He sings Baritone for the Glee Club and has been with us for 8 semesters.

When asked what his plans are for the future he said, "Great question! I do not have any plans set in place, but I want to end up working with people as much as possible, ideally somewhere that is warmer than Iowa. 

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "On our last morning in Wales during Tour XX, myself and about 10 other Glee Club guys got up at 3:30 AM to go on a hike and watch the sunrise. We were really tired and had to walk quite a distance, but the views from the cliff where we watched the sunrise over the Irish Sea were stunning. We were there for about 4 hours singing and taking in the view. I know that many years down the road I will remember that moment and the brothers that I shared it with."

You're the man, Dan! Thank you for all you have done for the group and best of luck in the future.
