Of the 52,730 people in our community - 19,060 of them are children, and many of them struggle with hunger. The Glee Club is committed to making the world a much better place for everyone.

That is why ALL proceeds of our new CD will be donated to the Northeast Iowa Food Bank, to assist families who are in urgent need of support during these historically challenging times.

We hope you can join us in sharing the blessings of the holiday season with our neighbors in need.
