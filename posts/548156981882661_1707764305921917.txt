Throughout the rest of the semester we will have a Facebook post for each of our graduating seniors. Our first Senior Spotlight is on Michael Alexander!

Michael is a Communication Studies major from Bettendorf, Iowa. He is in his 9th semester with the Glee Club and sings baritone. After graduation he hopes to move to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Next semester he will be staying in Cedar Falls to be in a musical. 

His favorite Glee Club memory was "Traveling overseas to Iceland/Norway, and Spain. Both tours were life-changing experiences where some of my best memories with the Glee Club were made. Choosing just one would be too hard! The experience of traveling overseas for the first time, sharing our music with different cultures, and forming strong connections with the people I traveled with were unbeatable and were among the greatest experiences of my life." 

Thank you for all you have done and best of luck, Michael!
