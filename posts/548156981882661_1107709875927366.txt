About 50 of the 70 guys going on Tour XIX to Iceland/Norway were able to help First Presbyterian Church of Waterloo move some furniture around early this morning. In exchange FPC agreed to host our Farewell Concert on Tuesday, May 17. We hope to see you there! (We also got a chance to sing!) Brothers, Sing On!
