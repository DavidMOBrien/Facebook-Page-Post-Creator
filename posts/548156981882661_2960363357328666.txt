Our next Senior Spotlight is on Bryce Cox! Bryce is majoring in Elementary Education and is from Mount Vernon, Iowa. After graduation, he plans to be a teacher in the Eastern Iowa area, working with grades anywhere from kindergarten to eighth-grade. He sings Tenor I and has been in the Glee Club for 8 semesters!

When asked about his favorite Glee Club memory he said, "While touring with the Glee Club in Wales, several of us decided to watch the sunrise together on our last day abroad. Early that morning, we hiked through a pasture of sheep to the top of a bluff, singing songs and laughing together as we watched the sunrise over the Irish Sea. It was a great moment that I will never forget."

Thank you, Bryce. We wish you the best of luck going forward!
