Our next Senior Spotlight is on Sean McCord! Sean is a Bass from Spencer, Iowa, and is pursuing a degree in Supply Chain Management here at UNI.

Sean's plans after graduation are to work full time, as he has accepted a full time position at the Menards distribution center down in Shelby Iowa. 

One of Sean's favorite memories from his time with the Glee Club took place during the 2016 European Tour in Iceland and Norway
"My favorite Glee Club Memory would be the Iceland/Norway trip. Traveling outside of the country with a great group of guys, and making friendships that would last a lifetime was an incredible experience. The late nights and early mornings with no sleep were all worth it. And, like many others, coming out of the church at Skalholt and singing Brothers Sing On, having the view in the background, and the realization that I was with my brothers in song: nothing can beat that moment."
