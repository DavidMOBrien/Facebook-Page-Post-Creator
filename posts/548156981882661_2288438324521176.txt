We invite you this weekend to attend a performance by our a cappella group, the SingPins! Glee Club alumni, Will Lubaroff, will be performing as well in his duo "Gable and Gray".

The show starts at 6:30 pm this Sunday, February 10th at the First Presbyterian Church of Cedar Falls. Refreshments will be served afterwards. We hope to see you there!
